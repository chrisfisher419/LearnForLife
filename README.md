# LearnForLife
Learn For Life is a Learning Management System that provides an easy-to-use interface for both students and teachers. The mission of Learn For Life is to inspire others to learn, and perpetuate the journey for knowledge. Learn For Life will provide teachers the ability to upload and manage courses, grades, and their students. Teachers can also offer to mentor students in need, or collaborate with other teachers and communicate with their students. Students can enroll into any course of their choosing or enroll into the courses related to their at-school studies, further amplifying their ability to learn within those classes. Students can also collaborate with one another, communicate with their instructors, and provide feedback for enhancing courses and improving instructing. Learn For Life can be used freely as an application, and can also be used within schools themselves, as a schools management system for education.
